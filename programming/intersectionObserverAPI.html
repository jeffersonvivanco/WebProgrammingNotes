    <h1>The Intersection Observer API</h1>
    <p>
        The Intersection Observer API allows you to configure a callback that is called whenever one element called, the 
        target, intersects either the device viewport or a specified element; for the purpose of this API, this is called
        the <b>root element</b> or <b>root</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Typically, you'll want to watch for intersection changes with regard to the document's viewport (which is done by 
        specifying <code>null</code> as the root element). Whether you're using the viewport or some other element as the root,
        the API works the same way, executing a callback function you provide whenever the visibility of the target element
        changes so that it crosses desired amounts of intersection with the root.
    </p>
    <p>
        The degree of intersection between the target element and its root is the <b>intersection ratio</b>. This is a 
        representation of the percentage of the target element which is visible as a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
    </p>

        // the element that is used as the viewport for checking visibility of the target. Must be the anscestor of the 
        // target. Defaults to the browser viewport if not specified or if null
        root: null,
        rootMargin: '0px', //margin arount the root
        threshold: .25 // 1.0 means that when 100% of the target is visible within the element specified by the root option
        // the callback is invoked 
    }

            entry.isIntersecting - You can tell which direction the visibility changed in  (that is, whether the element
                became more visible or less visible) by checking the value of this property. If this value is true, the
                target element has become at least as visible as the threshold that was passed. If it's false, the target
                is no longer as visible as the given threshold.
