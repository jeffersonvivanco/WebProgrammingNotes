Rendering an element into the Dom
* <div id="root"></div>
  * We call this a "root" DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.
  * Apps built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating
    React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.
  * To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render(), for ex:
    const el = <h1>Hello!</h1>
    ReactDOM.render(el, document.getElementById('root'));
